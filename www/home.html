<p>INI (INI is Not ISEP) is a rule-based research language. 
The goal is to find out if this kind of language is suitable to write programs with high I/O and parallel execution needs.

<p>INI is full open source and free to use.

<p>To get started, please read the <a href="manual/ini_manual.html">reference documentation</a> (download <a href="manual/ini_manual.pdf">PDF version</a>). You can also checkout the online executable examples.

<p>INI is work in progress. It is heading towards an alpha version and any help would be greatly appreciated :).
