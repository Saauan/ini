 author = {Rean Griffith and Gail Kaiser and Joseph L. Hellerstein and Yixin Diao},
 year = {2008},
 abstract = {Temporal event correlation is essential to realizing self-managing distributed systems. Autonomic controllers often require that events be correlated across multiple components using rule patterns with timer-based transitions, e.g., to detect denial of service attacks and to warn of staging problems with business critical applications. This short paper discusses automatic adjustment of timer values for event correlation rules, in particular compensating for the variability of event propagation delays due to factors such as contention for network and server resources. We describe a corresponding Management Station architecture and present experimental studies on a testbed system that suggest that this approach can produce results at least as good as an optimal fixed setting of timer values. 1.},

Tom bridges thus the gap between a general purpose language and high level specifications based on rewriting. This approach was motivated by the promotion of rule based techniques and their integration in large scale applications. Powerful matching capabilities along with a rich strategy language are among Tom's strong features that make it easy to use and competitive with respect to other rule based languages. Tom is thus a natural choice for querying and transforming structured data and in particular XML documents. We present here its main XML oriented features and illustrate its use on several examples.}},
